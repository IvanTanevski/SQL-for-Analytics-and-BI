Advanced SQL + MySQL for Analytics &amp; Business Intelligence - Tasks and Projects

Intermediate complex analytics SQL codes for e-commerce database. The codes are some more challenging assignments and projects from Udemy Project-like Course "Advanced SQL + MySQL for Analytics and Business Intelligence" by Maven Analytics. I found them very useful, real world-like examples.
All code is my own, and bit different from the solution video by the instructor. Some codes can be similar to the course solutions 
because it's made and guided from the lectures before this project. Whenever possible I tried to implement more than one solution. 
Also the YEAR() function in the mid-course project I added after watching the solution video for the project. It is not necessary for
obtaining correct result, but it's pretty much clearer with year extracted in the result sets before the month number.
